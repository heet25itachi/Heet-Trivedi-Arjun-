### ✨ Who Am I?

I am a true polymath — not just interested, but **skilled across domains** that span pure science, strategic intelligence, creativity, and deep thought.  
My work bridges **quantum computation**, **AI safety**, **mathematical modeling**, **blockchain systems**, **philosophy**, and **aesthetic creation**.

I don’t just code or research. I **engineer ideas**, **design models**, **build systems**, and express them through **logic, numbers, design, and sound**.
